                  studies. Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and cybersecurity
                  are the aspects that interest me because they are becoming key
                  factors in the 4.0 world so knowing more about them could
                  provide opportunities for us in the future. I was taught about
                  excel and access during my studies so I have a lack of
                  knowledge and experience in IT, which could prevent me from

                  Nowadays, the emergence of sophisticated smartphone technology
                  leads to the growth of mainstream augmented reality, which is
                  undoubtedly one of the most important features not only in the
                  scientific field but also in our daily life. Like Tim Cook-
                  Apple's chief executive- said âI do think that a significant
                  portion of the population of developed countries, and
                  eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day,
                  almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much
                  a part of you.â.Augmented reality enables us to easily
                  construct anything we want to see in real life with computers
                  and integrate them into our surroundings.
                  <br /><br />Therefore, it's important to grasp what augmented
                  reality is to keep up with those developments so our group has
                  decided to create a website that contains definitions,
                  technologies, hardware software, applications and the benefits
                  of AR to help the readers understand clearly AR and its
                  potential in the future. This website will assist users in
                  gaining complete AR knowledge while also saving time.
                  Furthermore, it assists users in avoiding disinformation and
                  the need to gather information from a variety of sources.

                  Due to the spread of Covid-19, the necessity of
                  non-face-to-face servicing is growing. Many customer services
                  and other businesses that demand waiting for lines and screen
                  touch find it challenging to maintain social distance, but AR
                  may be able to lessen such requirements more safely through
                  its applications. Therefore, Augmented Reality (AR) starts to
                  appear more frequently in our everyday life with the
                  relentless development of technology and computer science.<br />
                  <br />
                  For example, Filter (on Snapchat, Instagram, â¦), and the
                  Pokemon Go game, ... are the practical applications of AR that
                  are extremely familiar to us. Moreover, AR technology has been
                  implemented in many other industries such as education,
                  entertainment, fashionâ¦ and even the eCommerce area. AR
                  currently is the IT trend that is predicted to thrive
                  significantly shortly, that is why AR has become a promising
                  field for any developed or developing country and future
                  employers could easily take advantage of this knowledge in the
                  website to apply AR to their business.

                  There are a plethora of websites and blogs offering
                  information about augmented reality, including Wikipedia,
                  Investopedia, and dozens of others. However, they are all
                  articles and blogs addressing some sides of AR and no single
                  website can supply all of the information that readers
                  want.<br /><br />
                  From all of those, Wikipedia can provide readers with lots of
                  AR information but it is impossible to know if that
                  information is reliable or not because it can be changed by
                  anybody. Our website will be entirely dedicated to the subject
                  of AR and all content, which comes from legitimate and
                  trustworthy sources, can only be altered by our group.
                  Moreover, we also provide a chatbox where people may ask
                  inquiries regarding AR-related topics.

                <p>
                  Initially, our group could not come up with any interesting
                  ideas for this project due to their lack of experience and
                  knowledge as freshman students. We have looked up online
                  possible IT projects and already found the topic that we think
                  is the most suitable and simple. Unfortunately, that topic
                  turned out to be ambiguous and demanding as we develop the
                  branches of it and since there are few documents about it, we
                  faced a lot of obstacles in gathering information necessary
                  for our project. This created a huge confusion among the
                  members of the group. We quickly grasped that we could not
                  continue on this topic anymore so we decided to have a meeting
                  to discuss it again. After long hours of debating and
                  brainstorming, we finally reached an agreement. This time the
                  topic was changed to Augmented Reality (AR) - a definition
                  that we have already encountered in the lecture. One of the
                  reasons why we choose this topic is its relation to the
                  Information Technology field and the future careers.

                  A real-time direct or indirect view of a physical real-world
                  environment that has been augmented by the addition of virtual
                  computer-generated information is characterised as Augmented
                  Reality (AR). AR is both interactive and 3D-registered,
                  combining both real and virtual things. A computer-rendered
                  image or data is superimposed over the real-world location of
                  your brain. It is the addition of sensory input to your brain
                  as it receives its usual sensory input from the environment.

                    As practical as it is, AR's first emergence was in peopleâs
                    imagination. In 1901, L. Frank Baum - an American prominent
                    novelist who is well-known for his children's books - wrote

                          Techniques for creating fictional worlds, enhancing
                          the audience's experience through senses have always
                          been goals to any passionate artist and Morton Heilig
                          was not an exception. After the promoting movie This
                          is Cinerama was released in 1952, Morton Heilig - a
                          cinematographer - became enamoured with 3D films and
                          cinerama with an aspiration for future cinema. Later
                          on in 1958, an individual console was devised with
                          diversities of inputs namely stereoscopic
                          illustration, movable chair, sound, fragrance, blowing
                          air. Morton later applied for a patent on it as
                          Sensorama Simulator, which was planned to simulate a
                          realistic experience (according to the filmâs script)
                          based on oneâs senses. Although it was not controlled
                          by the computer, it was the first effort on including
                          the effects in the audienceâs experience.

                    I.4.0, AR equipped for making a framework that is equivalent
                    to the genuine world and considerably more of creating
                    better and proficient quality. AR frameworks are based upon
                    three significant structure blocks: Visualisation, binding
                    engagement, and actual cooperation with a wider influence.
                    By completely engaging with the audience and using an AR
                    technique, graphical directions and animation may be
                    pre-coded and visualised the information in and out of the
                    box without any external distractions. AR influences
                    emotional experience by persuading the user to engage in a
                    binding encounter,which increases the customerâs desire to
                    purchase a product or service. Moreover, it also creates
                    unique collaborative experiences and aids in an increased
                    conceptual understanding, which improves the collaboration
                    in the organisation.

                          The coexistence of virtual objects and real
                          environments allows learners to visualise complex

                          mixed reality, and establishes crucial practices that

                          see-through HMDs and face-snapping, which allows fast

                          Besides those, AR may be used to display a real-world
                          combat scenario and add annotations to it. Using

                          real-time enemy action because the system includes

                          for entertainment purpose are marker-based
                          applications and location-based applications.
                          Market-based applications are based on image
                          recognition, which the phone's camera is initially
                          aimed towards the location of any marker where the
                          needed or embedded digital material is overlaid on top
                          of the real item.The other application works without
                          the marker, which is the location-based application.
                          The technology uses a global positioning system (GPS)
                          or a digital compass to determine the user's location,
                          after which real-world physical things are substituted
                          or combined with the augmented objects. Although AR
                          games are limited in terms of physical components and
                          face-to-face contact, distant multiplayer games have
                          enhanced collaborative gaming and connection
                          development. Since AR allows users to build all kinds
                          of scenarios and supports highly complicated
                          puzzles,models, and virtual opponents, the emotional
                          and mental sides of a game have a significant
                          potential.

                          spectators, AR makes spectator sports more enjoyable.
                          An AR-based sports system requires two fundamental
                          steps: homography estimation and automated player
                          recognition. A marker-based technique based on picture
                          patterns was developed for homography estimation, and
                          a markerless approach that works for natural images
                          with discrete local patterns was developed for
                          automatic player recognition.

                          the need of establishing a location-based device is
                          crucial to help the users get information about the
                          nearby area. The user interface should be able to not
                          only locate the user's position, but also give
                          background information about the region that may be of
                          interest, which has sparked a lot of interest in
                          developing a tourist application for mobile phones.

                        <p>
                          The majority of smartphones have navigation and
                          GPS-map-based systems that can determine the user's
                          actual position. According to the literature, mobile
                          phones can access up-to-date content, convey text,
                          picture, and video data in a flexible manner, and give
                          extra information on a map-based system. However, such
                          programs are currently being enhanced because their
                          features are extremely limited and do not support
                          multi-user usage. Therefore, the tourism industry
                          faces a great challange for many destinations around
                          the globe that lack sufficient funding opportunities
                          when AR requires constant investment into new
                          technologies, preferably for mobile use, in order to
                          continue attracting visitors.

                    AR recently is still in its beginning stages. As a result,
                    AR has every forthcoming possibility in later applications.
                    Future AR is considered to provide the interaction between
                    human and the objects directly without the use of any midway
                    devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, AR is also a great device to assist individuals
                    who suffer from sensory disability by replacing their absent
                    sense. For example, AR provides those who have hearing
                    problems with a visual view guiding them to keep up with the
                    missed audial sign. Advances of AR also means the issues
                    regarding social advocacy, privacy and ethics.

                  <p>
                    Since we are developing a website, we will be using HTML
                    (the standard markup language for documents meant to be
                    displayed in a web browser) to construct the basic website
                    layout. <br />
                    <br />
                    To make the website more user-friendly, we will utilize CSS
                    (Cascading Style Sheets, a style sheet language used for
                    specifying the display of a document expressed in a markup
                    language) to separate presentation from content (layout,
                    colours, fonts,...). We will also use JavaScript (commonly
                    abbreviated as JS) to handle client-side web page behaviour.

                    On the coding front, we will be utilising Visual Studio Code
                    (often known as VS Code), which is available for free for
                    personal or business usage. This program allows us to
                    examine our website with real-time updates, which is more
                    handier when planning the website layout. We also can
                    connect with one another via our GitHub or Microsoft
                    accounts, allowing numerous individuals to collaborate on
                    the same project. <br />
                    <br />
                    Khang is also familiar with the program, but just on the
                    interface side considering he primarily uses it for coding.
                    The other individuals are relatively new to the software
                    since they are new to IT or IT is not their main major.
                    Fortunately, the course includes some tutorials on how to
                    utilise the program, which helps to resolve this problem.

                    We will put all of our code and various supplementary files

Performance testing and 10 Usability Heuristics Design should be taken into account. All of the duties are aimed at guaranteeing that our final product performs well and meets user expectations.

                We need the help of many individuals to get the project from
                idea to product. As a result, I've identified certain
                specialists who will be needed to construct this application. It
                will be incredibly impossible to turn this idea into a real-life
                product without the assistance of these individuals. They are
                two full-stack developers, two software engineers, one tester
                and one product manager for filling all the requirements below.
